## Overview

Observer Universe is an interactive web project exploring the idea that observation influences reality.

The system is inspired by quantum mechanics, where particles behave differently when measured. In this environment, visual elements exist in unstable states until interaction stabilizes them. When attention is sustained, structures become defined. When ignored, they dissolve.

The project connects science, philosophy, art, technology, and spirituality within a single responsive system.

## Experience Structure

1. Concept introduction  
2. User instructions  
3. Interactive environment  

In the interactive phase:

• Continuous movement increases instability  
• Sustained stillness stabilizes nearby elements  
• Stabilized structures accumulate  
• Excess motion returns the system to uncertainty  

Each session develops differently based on user behavior.

## Project Goal

To create a web-based environment where users experience how attention alters structure and behavior within a system.
