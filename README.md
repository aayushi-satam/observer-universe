# OBSERVER UNIVERSE
### A Private Editorial Experiment

**Observer Universe** is a digital sanctuary where reality reacts to your presence. Inspired by the "Vogue" aesthetic and quantum theory, this space only truly exists when you are looking at it.

## ✧ The Vision
In this universe, you are the central force. The floating geometries, the ambient soundscapes, and the shifting typography are all tethered to your focus. If you look away, the universe resets; if you engage, it glows.

## ✧ Atmosphere
* **Dynamic Focus:** Objects expand and radiate light as they detect your observation.
* **Cinematic Sound:** An immersive loop of *DeeperMeaning.mp3* that breathes with your movement.
* **Editorial Texture:** A vintage grainy film overlay to bridge the gap between digital and tactile art.
* **Responsive Physics:** High-contrast interactions that respond to every click and scroll.
