## Concept

Observer Universe is an interactive web experience exploring the idea that observation shapes reality.

Inspired by principles from quantum mechanics, the system behaves probabilistically. Visual elements exist in unstable states until approached. Proximity increases definition. Distance returns them to uncertainty.

The work sits at the intersection of:

Science
Philosophy
Art
Technology
Spirituality

## Interaction Model

The experience unfolds in three stages:
1. Cinematic Initiation (Splash Screen)
2. User Observation (The Scroll)
3. Interactive Environment (The Canvas)

Inside the environment:

• **Cursor Proximity:** Stabilizes and scales floating geometries
• **Focus Glow:** Objects radiate light when under the lens of the observer
• **Kinetic Typography:** Headlines tilt and track based on mouse perspective
• **Reactive Sound:** DeeperMeaning.mp3 responds to interaction intensity
• **Film Texture:** A vintage grainy overlay provides tactile quality
• **Energy Bursts:** Clicks generate radial dispersion of matter

## System Design

The universe includes:

• Multi-layered geometric structures
• Reactive particle systems (Canvas API)
• Bloom-style glow and depth simulation
• Ambient + reactive Web Audio engine
• Custom interactive 'Lens' cursor
• High-contrast 'Vogue' inspired editorial layout

All visuals and sound are generated in real time.

## Technical Stack

HTML
CSS
JavaScript (Canvas API + Web Audio API)

No external frameworks.

## Goal

To create a responsive system where attention acts as an active force, allowing users to experience interaction as structural influence rather than passive viewing.
