# Observer Universe

## The Journey

1. **The Prologue:** A silent, minimalist exploration of the five pillars: Science, Philosophy, Art, Technology, and Spirituality.
2. **The Transition:** A moment of choice—deciding to enter the quantum void.
3. **The Quantum Jungle:** A hyper-vibrant, reactive environment where observation (mouse movement) physically alters the geometry and connectivity of the universe.

## Core Principles

* **Science:** Inspired by the Copenhagen Interpretation—reality is probabilistic until measured.
* **Philosophy:** Addresses the 'Tree in the Forest' paradox through direct interaction.
* **Art:** Uses generative canvas systems to visualize the invisible.
* **Technology:** Built with vanilla JS, Canvas API, and Web Audio API for real-time reactivity.
* **Spirituality:** Explores the collapse of the boundary between the observer and the observed.

## Interaction Model

* **Proximity:** Objects scale and brighten as the cursor approaches.
* **Entanglement:** Particles form neural-like connections only when 'observed' by the mouse.
* **Sonic Bloom:** Atmospheric audio swells upon entering the interaction space.
* **Motion Trails:** Visual persistence representing the 'memory' of past observations.
