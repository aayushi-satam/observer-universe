## Concept

Observer Universe is an interactive web experience exploring the idea that observation shapes reality.

Inspired by principles from quantum mechanics, the system behaves probabilistically. Objects exist in unstable states until measured. When attention stabilizes them, they collapse into form. When ignored, they dissolve.

The work sits at the intersection of:

Science  
Philosophy  
Art  
Technology  
Spirituality

## Experience

The project begins with a conceptual introduction, followed by instructions for interaction, and then transitions into a responsive environment.

Inside the interactive space:

• Movement introduces instability  
• Sustained stillness triggers state collapse  
• Stabilized structures accumulate  
• Continued motion returns elements to uncertainty  

Each session develops differently depending on user behavior.

## Technical Structure

Built using:

HTML  
CSS  
JavaScript (Canvas API)

The system uses generative logic and real-time interaction to simulate probabilistic behavior.

## Goal

To create a web-based system where attention directly influences visual and structural outcomes, allowing users to experience observation as an active force.
