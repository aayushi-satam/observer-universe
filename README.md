## Concept

Observer Universe is an interactive web experience exploring the idea that observation shapes reality.

Inspired by principles from quantum mechanics, the system behaves probabilistically. Visual elements exist in unstable states until approached. Proximity increases definition. Distance returns them to uncertainty.

The work sits at the intersection of:

Science  
Philosophy  
Art  
Technology  
Spirituality

## Interaction Model

The experience unfolds in three stages:
1. Concept introduction  
2. User initiation  
3. Interactive environment  

Inside the environment:

• Cursor proximity stabilizes forms  
• Clicks generate energy bursts  
• Geometry rotates and shifts in depth  
• Particles disperse and decay  
• Sound responds to interaction intensity  
• Continuous ambient tone evolves dynamically  

Every session differs based on movement and timing.

## System Design

The universe includes:

• Multi-layered geometric structures  
• Reactive particle systems  
• Bloom-style glow effects  
• Ambient + reactive Web Audio  
• Custom interactive cursor  
• Depth simulation through motion scaling  

All visuals and sound are generated in real time.

## Technical Stack

HTML  
CSS  
JavaScript (Canvas API + Web Audio API)

No external frameworks.

## Goal

To create a responsive system where attention acts as an active force, allowing users to experience interaction as structural influence rather than passive viewing.
