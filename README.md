# Observer Universe

**[→ Experience it here](https://aayushi-satam.github.io/observer-universe/)**

---

An interactive web experience where reality depends on your attention.

Inspired by quantum mechanics where particles behave differently when observed. Every object, sound, and word in this universe exists, changes, or disappears based on where you look. Move your cursor. Watch the world respond.

The project sits at the intersection of science, philosophy, art, technology, and spirituality. Each section invites you into a different lens on the same question:

*Does something exist if it is not seen?*

Typography dominates the screen. Objects drift in and out of existence. A generative soundscape breathes around you. And every visit is unique. You author your own version of this universe simply by being present in it.

*Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks. No libraries. Just attention.*
