# OBSERVER UNIVERSE
### An Interactive Editorial Experience

**Observer Universe** is a digital art piece inspired by quantum mechanics and minimalist editorial design. In this universe, reality is a product of attention—visuals, soundscapes, and typography react physically to the viewer's presence.

## ✧ The Concept
The project explores the relationship between the observer and the observed. Drawing from the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the environment remains in a state of flux until focused upon. 

## ✧ Features
* **Generative Geometry:** Floating objects that expand and glow when "observed" by the cursor.
* **Sonic Layer:** A responsive audio engine featuring *DeeperMeaning.mp3* that swells in volume as you navigate sections.
* **Vogue Typography:** Headlines that utilize perspective-shift tracking to follow mouse movement.
* **Big Bang Physics:** Interactive radial explosions triggered by user clicks.
* **Editorial Layout:** A high-contrast, "Vogue" inspired minimalist aesthetic with grainy film textures.

## ✧ Technology Stack
* **Engine:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
* **Visuals:** HTML5 Canvas API
* **Audio:** Web Audio API
* **Interactions:** Intersection Observer API
* **Styling:** CSS3 with SVG Filter Effects
