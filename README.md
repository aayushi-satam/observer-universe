## Concept

Observer Universe is an interactive web experience exploring the idea that observation shapes reality.

Inspired by principles from quantum mechanics, the system behaves probabilistically. Objects exist in unstable states until measured. When attention stabilizes them, they collapse into form. When ignored, they dissolve.

The work sits at the intersection of:

Science  
Philosophy  
Art  
Technology  
Spirituality

## How It Works

The experience unfolds in phases:

1. Conceptual introduction (OBJECTIVE → SCIENCE → ART → PHILOSOPHY → TECHNOLOGY → SPIRITUALITY)
2. Instruction phase
3. Interactive universe

Inside the universe:

• Movement creates instability  
• Stillness triggers collapse  
• Structures accumulate through interaction  
• Excess motion causes decoherence  

The system responds to cursor behavior, simulating probabilistic state change.

Each session evolves differently.

## Core Idea

Speed introduces noise.  
Stillness produces form.  

Observation is participation.

## Built With

HTML  
CSS  
JavaScript (Canvas API)  

No frameworks.  
No external libraries.  
Pure generative logic.

## Project Goal

To create an immersive environment where users feel that their attention directly influences the structure of reality.

The universe does not simply animate.

It responds.
