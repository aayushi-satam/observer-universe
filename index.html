            <h2>SCIENCE</h2>
            <p>The project is inspired by quantum mechanics. Particles behave differently when observed. Here, objects follow similar rules. When you look at them, they appear or change.</p>
            
            <h2>ART</h2>
            <p>The visuals, typography, and motion are carefully designed. The environment is an interactive artwork where every element is part of the composition and reacts to your presence.</p>
            
            <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
            <p>The experience raises questions about reality. Does something exist if it is not seen? Your interaction shapes what is real in this universe.</p>
            
            <h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
            <p>This universe is powered by a custom JavaScript physics engine using the HTML5 Canvas API. Particles calculate real-time proximity to your cursor, transitioning from waves to solid matter through localized observation.</p>
            
            <h2>SPIRITUALITY</h2>
            <p>The artwork reflects impermanence and awareness. Observing the environment is an act of participation. Your attention creates the universe around you.</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION QUESTIONS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What exists when you are not looking?</li>
                <li>How does attention shape reality?</li>
                <li>Can you notice impermanence in the world around you?</li>

            <h2>THE VOID</h2>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Your cursor represents the act of observation. Movement creates light, connection, and sound. In silence and stillness, the universe recedes.</p>
