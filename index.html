<h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
<p>
To let you experience a world where reality depends on observation.
The objects, sounds, and text in this universe exist, change, or disappear based on your attention.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>SCIENCE</h1>
<p>
The project is inspired by quantum mechanics. Particles behave differently when observed.
Here, objects follow similar rules. When you look at them, they appear or change.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>ART</h1>
<p>
The visuals, typography, and motion are carefully designed.
The environment is an interactive artwork where every element reacts to your presence.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
<p>
Does something exist if it is not seen?
Your interaction shapes what is real in this universe.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
<p>
Generative code makes objects, sounds, and text respond to your attention.
Each session is unique.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>SPIRITUALITY</h1>
<p>
Observing the environment is participation.
Your attention creates the universe around you.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>HOW TO EXPERIENCE</h1>
<p>
Move slowly.<br>
Pause.<br>
When you hold still, reality stabilizes.<br>
Move again, and it dissolves.
